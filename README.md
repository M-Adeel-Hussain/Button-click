1. Exception Handling
Adding a try-catch block ensures the application doesn't crash unexpectedly. It helps catch errors and displays a user-friendly message.

2. Welcome Message
Before launching the main form (Form1), a MessageBox will greet the user, enhancing the user experience.

3. Improved UI & Design
Add custom styling to Form1 (change background color, fonts, and button styles).
Implement dark mode support.
Use animations or transitions for a smoother user experience.
4. Logging Errors
If an error occurs, it can be logged in a file instead of just displaying a message. This helps in debugging.

5. Splash Screen
A loading screen before opening the main form can make the app feel more polished.
